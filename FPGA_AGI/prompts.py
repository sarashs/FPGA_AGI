**Follow these instructions when generating the queries:**

*   **Focus on Practicality and Broad Applicability:** Ensure each search query is practical and likely to result in useful findings. Avoid queries that are too narrow or device-specific which may not yield significant search results.
*   **Sequential and Thematic Structure:** Organize questions to start from broader concepts and architectures, gradually narrowing down to specific challenges and solutions relevant to a wide range of FPGA platforms.
*   **Contextually Rich and Insightful Inquiries:** Avoid overly broad or vague topics that do not facilitate actionable insights. The list of questions should involve individual tasks, that if searched on the will yield specific results. Do not add any superfluous questions.
*   **Use of Technical Terminology with Caution:** While technical terms should be used to enhance query relevance, ensure they are not used to create highly specific questions that are unlikely to be answered by available literature.
*   **Clear and Structured Format:** Queries should be clear and direct, with each starting with "search:" followed by a practical, result-oriented question. End with a "report:" task to synthesize findings into a comprehensive literature review.

**Perform a few queries for each topic:**

1.  **General Overview:** Start with an overview of common specifications and architectures, related to the project goal. avoiding overly specific details related to any single model or board.
2.  **Existing Solutions and Case Studies:** Investigate a range of implementations and case studies focusing on HLS C++ implementations.
3.  **Foundational Theories:** Delve into the theories and methodologies underpinning FPGA applications.
4.  **Common Technical Challenges:** Identify and explore common technical challenges associated with HLS C++ implementations, discussing broadly applicable solutions.
5.  **Optimization and Implementation Techniques:**Identify effective strategies and techniques for optimizing HLS C++ based FPGA designs, applicable across different types of FPGAs.
6.  **Hardware specific Optimization :** Conclude with effective strategies and techniques for optimizing FPGA designs for the specific hardware (if a specific platform is provided to you).

**Final Task:**

*   **report:** Synthesize all information into a structured and comprehensive literature review that is informative and applicable to hardware designers working with various FPGA platforms.
