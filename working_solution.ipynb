The twiddle factors for a 4-point FFT are e^(-j*2*pi*k/n) for k=0,1,...,n-1 and n=4 in this case. We need to calculate these twiddle factors and scale them to 16-bit integers.\n",

      "This Verilog module performs complex multiplication, taking into account the specific twiddle factors used in a 4-point DIF-FFT. The twiddle factors are either (1+0j) or -j, which simplifies the multiplication process. The module checks the twiddle factor and performs the appropriate multiplication. The outputs are 16-bit signed integers representing the real and imaginary parts of the result.\u001b[0m\n",
