Recall from Section \\n5.2.4  that ALUControl  is 000 for addition, 001 for subtraction, 010 for \\nAND, 011 for OR, and 101 for set less than.\\nFigure 7.10  shows the enhanced datapath handling these R-type \\ninstructions. The datapath reads rs1 and rs2 from ports 1 and 2 of the \\nregister file and performs an ALU operation on them. We introduce a \\nmultiplexer and a new select signal, ALUSrc , to select between ImmExt  \\nand RD2  as the second ALU source, SrcB. For lw and sw, ALUSrc  is \\n1 to select ImmExt ; for R-type instructions, ALUSrc  is 0 to select the  \\nregister file output RD2  as SrcB.Figure 7.9 Write data to memory for sw instructionCLK\\nAR D\\nInstruction\\nMemoryA1\\nA3\\nWD3RD2RD1WE3\\nA2CLK\\nAR D\\nData\\nMemoryWE\\nPC InstrCLK\\nPCNext\\nRegister\\nFile\\n0x10040x0064A4230x2004 19:15\\n9\\nImmExt\\n31:7\\n0x000000080x008SrcBSrcA\\nALUALUContro l2:0\\n000\\n0x200 C\\nAddress Instruction Type Fields Machine LanguageALUResult ReadDat a\\n11:7\\n4PCPlus 4PCNex t\\n0x1008\\n+WD', metadata={'page': 425, 'source': 'Sarah Harris, David Harris - Digital Design and Computer Architecture_ RISC-V Edition-Morgan Kaufmann (2021).pdf'})]}\u001b[0m\n",

      "\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThe search did not yield a direct VHDL example for an AXI Lite interface. However, I can use my knowledge of the AXI Lite protocol and VHDL to create the AXI Lite Interface module. The AXI Lite interface is a simplified version of the full AXI interface, which is suitable for communication with control registers and is typically used for slower, control-oriented interactions. It consists of read and write channels, each with its own set of signals. I will need to implement the AXI Lite read and write channels, handling the necessary handshaking and data transfer.\n",
