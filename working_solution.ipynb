William Kahan, primary architect of the original IEEE 754 floating-point standard noted, \"For now the 10-byte Extended format is a tolerable compromise between the value of extra-precise arithmetic and the price of implementing it to run fast; very soon two more bytes of precision will become tolerable, and ultimately a 16-byte format ... That kind of gradual evolution towards wider precision was already in view when IEEE Standard 754 for Floating-Point Arithmetic was framed.\"\\nIn IEEE 754-2008 the 128-bit base-2 format is officially referred to as binary128.\\n\\nIEEE 754 quadruple-precision binary floating-point format: binary128\\nThe IEEE 754 standard specifies a binary128 as having:\\n\\nSign bit: 1 bit\\nExponent width: 15 bits\\nSignificand precision: 113 bits (112 explicitly stored)\\nThis gives from 33 to 36 significant decimal digits precision. If a decimal string with at most 33 significant digits is converted to the IEEE 754 quadruple-precision format, giving a normal number, and then converted back to a decimal string with the same number of digits, the final result should match the original string. If an IEEE 754 quadruple-precision number is converted to a decimal string with at least 36 significant digits, and then converted back to quadruple-precision representation, the final result must match the original number.\\nThe format is written with an implicit lead bit with value 1 unless the exponent is stored with all zeros. Thus only 112 bits of the significand appear in the memory format, but the total precision is 113 bits (approximately 34 decimal digits: log10(2^113) ≈ 34.016). The bits are laid out as:\\n\\nExponent encoding\\nThe quadruple-precision binary floating-point exponent is encoded using an offset binary representation, with the zero offset being 16383; this is also known as exponent bias in the IEEE 754 standard.\\n\\nEmin = 0001_16 − 3FFF_16 = −16382\\nEmax = 7FFE_16 − 3FFF_16 = 16383\\nExponent bias = 3FFF_16 = 16383\\nThus, as defined by the offset binary representation, in order to get the true exponent, the offset of 16383 has to be subtracted from the stored exponent.\\nThe stored exponents 0000_16 and 7FFF_16 are interpreted specially.\\n\\nExponent\\nSignificand zero\\nSignificand non-zero\\nEquation\\n\\n0000_16\\n0, −0\\nsubnormal numbers\\n(−1)^signbit × 2^−16382 × 0.significandbits_2\\n\\n0001_16, ..., 7FFE_16\\nnormalized value\\n(−1)^signbit × 2^exponentbits_2 − 16383 × 1.significandbits_2\\n\\n7FFF_16\\n±∞\\nNaN (quiet, signalling)\\n\\nThe minimum strictly positive (subnormal) value is 2^−16494 ≈ 10^−4965 and has a precision of only one bit.\\nThe minimum positive normal value is 2^−16382 ≈ 3.3621 × 10^−4932 and has a precision of 113 bits, i.e. ±2^−16494 as well.

Using pairs of IEEE double-precision values with 53-bit significands, double-double arithmetic provides operations on numbers with significands of at least 2 × 53 = 106 bits (actually 107 bits except for some of the largest values, due to the limited exponent range), only slightly less precise than the 113-bit significand of IEEE binary128 quadruple precision. The range of a double-double remains essentially the same as the double-precision format because the exponent has still 11 bits, significantly lower than the 15-bit exponent of IEEE quadruple precision (a range of 1.8 × 10^308 for double-double versus 1.2 × 10^4932 for binary128).\\nIn particular, a double-double/quadruple-precision value q in the double-double technique is represented implicitly as a sum q = x + y of two double-precision values x and y, each of which supplies half of q\\'s significand. That is, the pair (x, y) is stored in place of q, and operations on q values (+, −, ×, ...) are transformed into equivalent (but more complicated) operations on the x and y values. Thus, arithmetic in this technique reduces to a sequence of double-precision operations; since double-precision arithmetic is commonly implemented in hardware, double-double arithmetic is typically substantially faster than more general arbitrary-precision arithmetic techniques.\\nNote that double-double arithmetic has the following special characteristics:\\n\\nAs the magnitude of the value decreases, the amount of extra precision also decreases. Therefore, the smallest number in the normalized range is narrower than double precision. The smallest number with full precision is 1000...02 (106 zeros) × 2^−1074, or 1.000...02 (106 zeros) × 2^−968. Numbers whose magnitude is smaller than 2^−1021 will not have additional precision compared with double precision.\\nThe actual number of bits of precision can vary. In general, the magnitude of the low-order part of the number is no greater than half ULP of the high-order part. If the low-order part is less than half ULP of the high-order part, significant bits (either all 0s or all 1s) are implied between the significant of the high-order and low-order numbers. Certain algorithms that rely on having a fixed number of bits in the significand can fail when using 128-bit long double numbers.\\nBecause of the reason above, it is possible to represent values like 1 + 2^−1074, which is the smallest representable number greater than 1.\\nIn addition to the double-double arithmetic, it is also possible to generate triple-double or quad-double arithmetic if higher precision is required without any higher precision floating-point library. They are represented as a sum of three (or four) double-precision values respectively. They can represent operations with at least 159/161 and 212/215 bits respectively.\\nA similar technique can be used to produce a double-quad arithmetic, which is represented as a sum of two quadruple-precision values. They can represent operations with at least 226 (or 227) bits.\\n\\nImplementations\\nQuadruple precision is often implemented in software by a variety of techniques (such as the double-double technique above, although that technique does not implement IEEE quadruple precision), since direct hardware support for quadruple precision is, as of 2016, less common (see \"Hardware support\" below). One can use general arbitrary-precision arithmetic libraries to obtain quadruple (or higher) precision, but specialized quadruple-precision implementations may achieve higher performance.\\n\\nComputer-language support\\nA separate question is the extent to which quadruple-precision types are directly incorporated into computer programming languages.\\nQuadruple precision is specified in Fortran by the real(real128) (module iso_fortran_env from Fortran 2008 must be used, the constant real128 is equal to 16 on most processors), or as real(selected_real_kind(33, 4931)), or in a non-standard way as REAL*16. (Quadruple-precision REAL*16 is supported by the Intel Fortran Compiler and by the GNU Fortran compiler on x86, x86-64, and Itanium architectures, for example.)\\nFor the C programming language, ISO/IEC TS 18661-3 (floating-point extensions for C, interchange and extended types) specifies _Float128 as the type implementing the IEEE 754 quadruple-precision format (binary128). Alternatively, in C/C++ with a few systems and compilers, quadruple precision may be specified by the long double type, but this is not required by the language (which only requires long double to be at least as precise as double), nor is it common.\\nOn x86 and x86-64, the most common C/C++ compilers implement long double as either 80-bit extended precision (e.g. the GNU C Compiler gcc and the Intel C++ Compiler with a /Qlong‑double switch) or simply as being synonymous with double precision (e.g. Microsoft Visual C++), rather than as quadruple precision. The procedure call standard for the ARM 64-bit architecture (AArch64) specifies that long double corresponds to the IEEE 754 quadruple-precision format. On a few other architectures, some C/C++ compilers implement long double as quadruple precision, e.g. gcc on PowerPC (as double-double and SPARC, or the Sun Studio compilers on SPARC. Even if long double is not quadruple precision, however, some C/C++ compilers provide a nonstandard quadruple-precision type as an extension. For example, gcc provides a quadruple-precision type called __float128 for x86, x86-64 and Itanium CPUs, and on PowerPC as IEEE 128-bit floating-point using the -mfloat128-hardware or -mfloat128 options; and some versions of Intel\\'s C/C++ compiler for x86 and x86-64 supply a nonstandard quadruple-precision type called _Quad.\\nZig provides support for it with its f128 type.\\nGoogle\\'s work-in-progress language Carbon provides support for it with the type called \\'f128\\'.\\n\\nLibraries and toolboxes\\nThe GCC quad-precision math library, libquadmath, provides __float128 and __complex128 operations.\\nThe Boost multiprecision library Boost.Multiprecision provides unified cross-platform C++ interface for __float128 and _Quad types, and includes a custom implementation of the standard math library.\\nThe Multiprecision Computing Toolbox for MATLAB allows quadruple-precision computations in MATLAB. It includes basic arithmetic functionality as well as numerical methods, dense and sparse linear algebra.\\nThe DoubleFloats package provides support for double-double computations for the Julia programming language.\\nThe doubledouble.py library enables double-double computations in Python.\\nMathematica supports IEEE quad-precision numbers: 128-bit floating-point values (Real128), and 256-bit complex values (Complex256).\\n\\nHardware support\\nIEEE quadruple precision was added to the IBM System/390 G5 in 1998, and is supported in hardware in subsequent z/Architecture processors. The IBM POWER9 CPU (Power ISA 3.0) has native 128-bit hardware support. Native support of IEEE 128-bit floats is defined in PA-RISC 1.0, and in SPARC V8 and V9 architectures (e.g. there are 16 quad-precision registers %q0, %q4, ...), but no SPARC CPU implements quad-precision operations in hardware as of 2004. Non-IEEE extended-precision (128 bits of storage, 1 sign bit, 7 exponent bits, 112 fraction bits, 8 bits unused) was added to the IBM System/370 series (1970s–1980s) and was available on some System/360 models in the 1960s (System/360-85, -195, and others by special request or simulated by OS software).\\nThe Siemens 7.700 and 7.500 series mainframes and their successors support the same floating-point formats and instructions as the IBM System/360 and System/370.\\nThe VAX processor implemented non-IEEE quadruple-precision floating point as its \"H Floating-point\" format. It had one sign bit, a 15-bit exponent and 112-fraction bits, however the layout in memory was significantly different from IEEE quadruple precision and the exponent bias also differed. Only a few of the earliest VAX processors implemented H Floating-point instructions in hardware, all the others emulated H Floating-point in software.\\nThe NEC Vector Engine architecture supports adding, subtracting, multiplying and comparing 128-bit binary IEEE 754 quadruple-precision numbers. Two neighboring 64-bit registers are used. Quadruple-precision arithmetic is not supported in the vector register.\\nThe RISC-V architecture specifies a \"Q\" (quad-precision) extension for 128-bit binary IEEE 754-2008 floating-point arithmetic. The \"L\" extension (not yet certified) will specify 64-bit and 128-bit decimal floating point.')]\n",

       " 'Current estimates suggest that between 1 and 3 percent of people living in the United States will receive a diagnosis of mental retardation. This report assesses the process used by the U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) to identify individuals with cognitive limitations who experience significant problems in their ability to perform work and may therefore be in need of governmental support. It evaluates the existing disability determination process in the context of current scientific knowledge and clinical practice. Mental retardation, a condition characterized by deficits in intellectual capabilities and adaptive behavior, can be particularly difficult to diagnose in the mild range of the disability.',\n",
       " 'SSA administers two disability programs that provide income and medical benefits to individuals who are either unable to work or to function as expected given their age because of disability. The Disability Insurance (DI) program, which operates under Title II of the Social Security Act, provides monetary payments to formerly employed individuals who have contributed to the Social Security trust fund through Social Security tax on earnings. Certain classes of dependents of insured individuals are also eligible for DI benefits. The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, which operates under Title XVI of the Social Security Act, provides payments to individuals (including children younger than 18 years of age) with a disability who have limited income and other resources. Such a person does not have to have been employed or a contributor to Social Security to be eligible for SSI benefits, although a means test is applied to both income and assets.',\n",
       " \"Disability is defined similarly for both the DI and SSI programs. For all persons applying under the DI program and for adults applying under the SSI program, disability is defined as “the inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment(s) which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months” (Social Security Administration, 2002, p. 4). Standards are different for children younger than age 18. For this group, disability is defined as having a “medically determinable” physical or mental impairment, or combination of impairments that cause “marked and severe functional limitations.” The impairment must be expected to lead to death or to be present for a continuous 12-month period. A medically determinable impairment is one resulting from anatomical, physiological, or psychological abnormalities that can be established by medical evidence that includes signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings; findings must go beyond the individual's subjective complaints.\",\n",
       " \"The application process for DI and SSI benefits can be a long and complicated one. Individuals (or their parents or guardians) may file for disability benefits by telephone, mail, or by visiting the nearest Social Security Office. The nearest Social Security Office can be identified by calling the toll free number (1-800-772-1213; 1-800-325-0778 for TTY calls). An individual can also call the toll free number and make arrangements to complete an application by telephone. SSA will then set up a time for the local Social Security Office to contact the individual and take the application over the telephone. SSA's website (www.ssa.gov) has helpful information about qualification criteria and procedures for filing disability benefits.\",\n",
       " \"The in-person or telephone interview will be conducted by a claims representative of SSA. The claims representative will determine if the technical aspects of disability eligibility or entitlement are met. If the individual is eligible for benefits under the Title II program, or the Title XVI program, or both programs, the medical and vocational material is then forwarded to the state disability determination services (DDS) in the applicant's state. Medical information can include telephone numbers of doctors, hospitals, clinics, and institutions in which the person received treatment, as well as the dates of treatment; names of all medications currently being prescribed; medical records; and laboratory and test results. Vocational information can include summaries of previous work experiences and locations and a copy of a W-2 form.\",\n",
       " \"Trained disability examiners and medical consultants, who will review all the pertinent information and make the determination of disability, staff the DDS. DDS staff may require additional information in making their determinations—for example, information directly from the applicant's treating clinician. DDS staff may require the applicant to undergo an examination conducted by SSA-hired consultative examiners.\",\n",
       " 'DDS staff make the determination of disability based on the questions presented in Box 1-1.',\n",

       " \"The box outlines the five-step process for adults and the three-step process for children used to evaluate applicants for disability benefits. Beyond the stepwise determination process, there are several levels of appeal. There can be a hearing before an administrative law judge at SSA, review by SSA's Appeals Council, and ultimately review by the federal courts. Clearly, both the stepwise determination process and the appeals process involve the use of objective and subjective indicators, as well as many judgments on the part of those making the determinations. Such a process inevitably results in errors, which can be of two types: they can incorrectly exclude someone who is legally entitled to benefits or can incorrectly result in benefits for someone who is not entitled to them. Since both types of errors are costly to the individual and to society, it is important to identify the sources of error and to minimize them. Some are inherent in the criteria for disability determination and the assessment instruments used to determine whether the client meets them.\",\n",
       " 'SSA disability determination for mental retardation requires that the individual have “significantly sub-average general intellectual functioning with deficits in adaptive functioning initially manifested during the developmental period; i.e., the evidence demonstrates or supports onset of the impairment before age 22” (Social Security Administration, 2002, p. 76). Children must also have significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning with deficits in adaptive behavior. Since they are children and under age 22, such findings will have manifested during the developmental period. The Listing of Im\\npairments, which specifies medical criteria and associated diagnoses, includes separate criteria for adults and for children and adolescents with mental retardation.',\n",
       " 'Listing 12.05 of Part A lays out criteria for mental retardation; it is closely paraphrased here. In order to be found eligible for benefits due to mental retardation, adults must be mentally retarded as defined above, and must meet one of four requirements:',\n",
       " \"Satisfaction of any one of these four criteria in an individual who has mental retardation meets the step 3 criterion of SSA's determination process; i.e., that the individual has a prima facie case of disability that results in an inability to work.\",\n",
       " \"Separate determination criteria have been developed for children and adolescents, which recognize the different processes and effects that mental disorders have on their functioning. Determination criteria for children are further subdivided by age and associated developmental expectations. Criteria are provided for infants and toddlers (e.g., between ages 1 and 3) and three age groups of children and adolescents (e.g., ages 3 to 6, 6 to 12, and 12 to 18). These age criteria are designed to assess the severity of the disability's impact on the child's or adolescent's functioning, with benefits provided for conditions that cause “marked” restrictions, defined as “more than moderate but less than extreme.” On standardized tests, a score that is “two standard deviations below the mean for the test” is evidence of a marked restriction. A score that is three standard deviations below the mean on a standardized test is evidence of an extreme limitation.\",\n",
       " 'Medical criteria for evaluating children with mental retardation are described in Listing 112.05. Like the definition for adults, mental retardation in children for SSA disability purposes is characterized by significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning, with deficits in adaptive functioning. The Listing, again in paraphrase, includes six criteria for assessing severity of the condition:',\n",
       " 'The definition of mental retardation currently used by SSA differs from that used by other professional and health-related organizations. The concept of mental retardation, particularly a recognition that some portion of the population has cognitive deficits that significantly interfere with functioning, is an old one, although the ways in which this has been defined and measured have changed over time. Scheerenberger (1983) reports descriptions of the condition dating from 1500 B.C. in Egypt, in which disabilities of the mind and body due to brain damage were described.',\n",
       " 'Early definitions of the condition recognized differences in cognition that were associated with impaired functioning. In 1845, Esquirol (quoted in Scheerenberger, 1983) divided mental retardation into two primary categories based on performance on speech and language tasks. Seguin (1866) identified a severe defect in moral development as the primary characteristic of mental retardation.',\n",
       " \"According to Sheerenberger (1983), the major concepts common to current definitions of mental retardation were being used in the United States by 1900. These include onset during the developmental period (i.e., before age 22), intellectual deficits, and problems coping with the demands of everyday life. In its 1910 classification scheme, the progenitor of today's American Association on Mental Retardation (AAMR) (previously called the Association of Medical Officers of American Institutions for Idiotic and Feeble-minded Persons and the American Association on Mental Deficiency) issued its first formal definition of mental retardation. AAMR defined persons with mental retardation as being feeble-minded, with development arrested at an early age or as evidenced by an inability to manage the demands of daily life or to keep up with peers (Committee on Classification of Feeble-Minded, 1910). Mental retardation was further divided into three levels of impairment: “idiots” had their development arrested at the level of a 2-year-old; “imbeciles” were at the developmental level of a 2- to 7-year-old; and “morons” were at the development of a 7- to 12-year-old.\",\n",
       " 'Subsequent to the adoption of this definition, the field disagreed over whether mental retardation was a constitutional condition or one based on deficits in social competence (Biasini et al., 1999). Edgar Doll, for instance, proposed that mental retardation was a condition of genetic origin that resulted in social incompetence and arrested development (Doll, 1936a). He believed the condition was incurable. In contrast, Kuhlman (1920) proposed that the condition resulted from a subnormal rate of development, suggesting that it was a result of social functioning deficits rather than genetic conditions. Despite these differences in definition, however, they all focused on the inability to perform common behaviors, delays in social development, and low intelligence (Yepsen, 1941).',\n",
       " 'The 1959 AAMR definition was the first to integrate formally the measurement of intellectual capabilities and adaptive behavior functioning. This definition defined mental retardation as “subaverage general intellectual functioning which originates in the developmental period and is associated with impairment in adaptive behavior” (Jacobson, 1999). Subaverage intellectual functioning was defined as an IQ of 85 or less, with the developmental period extending only up to age 16. Deficits in adaptive behavior were a required part of the definition of the condition, even though there were no formal measures of the construct. AAMR recommended use of the Vineland Social Maturity Scale (Doll, 1953), with a subjective interpretation to be made by the evaluating clinician. A five-level classification scheme was also included for borderline (IQ 67-85), mild (IQ 50-66), moderate (IQ 33-49), severe (IQ 16-32), and profound (IQ <16) levels of retardation.',\n",
       " 'AAMR changed its definition in 1973, partly in response to concern about the inappropriate overidentification of minority students as mentally retarded. The new definition eliminated the classification of borderline retardation, and changed the upper criterion of scores on intelligence measures from 85 to 70 or below (Grossman, 1973). The result was a significant reduction in the numbers of children eligible for special school services and governmental supports. Levels of retardation were also redefined slightly.',\n",
       " \"AAMR's definition was revised again in 1977. This change suggested that IQs in the range of 70 to 75 might also be indicative of mental retardation if there were also significant deficits in adaptive behavior (Grossman, 1977). This change took into consideration the standard error of measurement on most tests of intelligence. In its most recent definition, adopted in 1992, AAMR has done away with the levels of retardation (American Association on Mental Retardation, 1992). The organization has also provided a list of 10 adaptive skill areas, with deficits in at least 2 of them required for a diagnosis of mental retardation. This current definition is discussed in more detail below.\",\n",
       " 'The American Psychiatric Association, in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), melded the 1977 and 1992 AAMR definitions, retaining the severity levels from 1972 and adopting a list of adaptive behavior areas similar to those chosen by AAMR in 1992. The DSM-IV also kept the upper limit of intelligence at equal to or less than 70.',\n",
       " 'It is important to note that the differences between the SSA definition of mental retardation and those of the major professional and health-related organizations derive from the purpose for which it is used. The SSA definition is used not for diagnostic purposes, but rather for purposes of program eligibility. The SSA definition fulfills its purpose of identifying individuals with cognitive limitations who experience significant problems in their ability to perform work and may therefore be in need of governmental support.',\n",
       " 'There are widely disparate prevalence estimates of mental retardation in the U.S. population. Different studies report different rates depending on the definitions used, methods of diagnosis, and the particular population studied. For instance, the DSM-IV estimates the prevalence of mental retardation at 1 percent, although the basis for this number is not provided (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). This estimate is similar to that provided by other researchers (Hodapp & Dykens, 1996). Baroff (1991), using empirical sampling, estimates that 0.9 percent of the U.S. population can be presumed to have mental retardation. In a review of epidemiological studies, McClaren and Bryson (1987) report the prevalence of mental retardation at 1.25 percent, based on total population screening. Among school-age children, the U.S. Department of Education (1994) reports that prevalence estimates provided by different states in determining eligibility for special educational services ranged from 0.3 to 2.5 percent. In contrast, the U.S. surgeon general has estimated that some 7.5 million persons living in the United States have a diagnosis of mental retardation, representing almost 3 percent of the population.',\n",
       " 'The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is conducting a longitudinal study called the Metropolitan Atlanta Developmental Disabilities Surveillance Program (MADDSP), which monitors the prevalence of developmental disabilities, including mental retardation, among children 3 to 10 years of age in the metropolitan Atlanta region (Boyle et al., 1996). The study used the definition of mental retardation listed in the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9) (World Health Organization, 1988), which includes severity ratings for mild, moderate, severe, and profound levels of retardation. Findings from the MADDSP indicate an overall prevalence of 8.7 per 1,000 children 3 to 10 years of age in Atlanta. Approximately two-thirds of all cases of retardation were of mild severity. Prevalence of mental retardation varied by age, ranging from 5.2/1,000 for children 3 to 4 years of age to 12.3/1,000 for children 9 to 10 years of age. Increases in prevalence were more likely to occur for children in the mild and moderate ranges of retardation, rather than in the severe and profound ranges.',\n",
       " 'These rates for children are similar to those reported in analyses of the National Health Interview Survey. Again, using the ICD-9 definition of mental retardation, Halfon and Newacheck (1999) reported unadjusted prevalence rates for mental retardation at 10.5/1,000 for children younger than 18. Analyses further indicated that the prevalence of mental retardation increased with age, ranging from 2.0/1,000 cases for children younger than 6, to 14.7/1,000 cases for children ages 6 to 12, and 15.7/1,000 cases for youth ages 12 to 17. The prevalence of mental retardation was also higher for males (13.0/1,000) than females (7.9/1,000).',\n",
       " \"Among different racial/ethnic groups, the prevalence of mental retardation was higher among black youth (16.2/1,000) than white (9.8/1,000), Hispanic (9.0/1,000) and other (6.4/1,000) youth. Prevalence rates are higher in some racial/ethnic groups partly because the responses to the National Health Interview Survey are provided by parents, who may have cultural reasons for concealing their child's cognitive disability. The correlation of low socioeconomic status and mental retardation is very high (see Chapter 2), and poverty rates are very high among black and Hispanic youth.\",\n",
       " 'These prevalence estimates are vastly different, ranging from a low of 1 percent to a high of almost 3 percent. It is likely that the actual number of individuals with mental retardation ranges between 1 and 3 percent. This suggests that between 2.8 million and 7.5 million individuals could be diagnosed as having mental retardation.',\n",
       " \"Individuals with a diagnosis of mental retardation constitute a significant number of all recipients of SSA disability benefits. Data from SSA's Annual Statistical Supplement (2001a) indicate that as of December 2000, 567,151 persons with a diagnosis of mental retardation were receiving DI benefits, including 257,601 workers, 299,925 children age 18 or older, and 9,625 widows or widowers. Individuals classified as mentally retarded represented 10 percent of all workers with disabilities.\",\n",

       " 'The diagnosis of mental retardation, as well as the receipt of benefits, has associated public policy implications. These policy issues relate to the context in which the program operates, as well as the impact of benefit receipt. Recipients get money to help with income maintenance, but they also get health care coverage through Medicaid. This health care coverage allows individuals with chronic medical conditions to receive needed treatment. In response to a number of issues, SSA changed the nature of its definitions of mental retardation and consequently the number of individuals receiving benefits. Any review of current practice has to consider that additional changes, while well meaning, may have negative effects on beneficiaries and the disability program itself. The committee has included an analysis of these issues in its assessment of the current determination system.',\n",
       " \"SSA's definition of mental retardation rests on subaverage intellectual functioning, either alone or in combination with other disabilities or functional impairments. The impairment must be present before the age of 22, although the diagnosis may be made at any time. This definition of mental retardation differs from that of several other organizations, including the American Psychiatric Association in its DSM-IV, the American Association of Mental Retardation, the World Health Organization in its International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), and Division 33 (Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities) of the American Psychological Association.\",\n",
       " 'DSM-IV defines mental retardation as significantly subaverage intellectual functioning (i.e., IQ no higher than approximately two standard deviations below the mean), which is accompanied by significant limitations in adaptive functioning in at least two of the following areas: communication, functional academic skills, health, home living, leisure, safety, self-care, self-direction, social/interpersonal skills, use of community resources, and work. Onset of these conditions must occur before age 18. The condition is further divided into four levels of retardation based on IQ, which include mild mental retardation (IQ between 50-55 and 70), moderate mental retardation (IQ between 35-40 and 50-55), severe mental retardation (IQ between 20-25 and 35-40), and profound mental retardation (IQ below 20 or 25) (American Psychiatric Association, 1994).',\n",
       " 'For AAMR, mental retardation is defined by substantial limitations in present functioning. It is defined as subaverage intellectual functioning that exists concurrently with deficits in two or more of the following adaptive skill areas: communication, self-care, home living, social skills, community use, self-direction, health and safety, functional academics, leisure, and work. The condition has to be manifested before age 18. AAMR further classifies mental retardation based on the nature and level of support needed by the individual, which can be intermittent, limited, extensive, or pervasive (American Association on Mental Retardation, 1992). These levels of support are not necessarily commensurate with the levels of retardation specified in the DSM-IV.',\n",
       " 'The World Health Organization (WHO), in its ICD-10, defines mental retardation as a “condition of arrested or incomplete development of the mind, which is especially characterized by impairment of skills manifested during the developmental period, which contribute to the overall level of intelligence, i.e., cognitive, language, motor, and social abilities.” Guidelines suggest that an IQ of less than 70 is indicative of mental retardation. ICD-10 further suggests the use of culturally relevant, standardized measures of social maturity and adaptation for assessing functional abilities. No guidelines are provided, however, on cutoff scores for adaptive behavior deficits. ICD-10 allows for assigning a diagnosis of mental retardation when an individual has both mental retardation and a coexisting mental or physical disorder.',\n",
       " 'Division 33 of the American Psychological Association has defined mental retardation as “(a) significant limitations in general intellectual functioning; (b) significant limitations in adaptive functioning, which exist concurrently; and (c) onset of intellectual and adaptive limitations before the age of 22 years” (Jacobson & Mulick, 1996). Significant limitations for both intellectual and adaptive functioning are defined as two or more standard deviations below the population mean, using standardized assessment tools.',\n",
       " 'These definitions differ from those offered by SSA on a number of dimensions. The most significant differences are focused on the age of onset (e.g., 18 versus 22 years of age) and the nature of adaptive functioning deficits and how they are to be measured. WHO and Division 33 advocate the use of a standardized measure of adaptive behavior functioning, while AAMR and the American Psychiatric Association allow for descriptors of functional deficits across different domains. Even with this latter approach, however, the number of areas in which functional limitations must be present also differs. The American Psychiatric Association allows for deficits in at least 2 of their 11 areas, and AAMR specifies deficits in at least 2 of its 10 adaptive skill areas. In contrast, SSA does not specify the number of areas that need to be deficient, relying instead on “marked” restriction of activities of daily living and “marked” difficulties with social functioning. It is worth noting again that SSA uses its definition of mental retardation not for diagnostic purposes, but rather to determine legal eligibility for its benefit programs, in order to ensure that federal resources are used justly and correctly.',\n",
       " 'SSA is similar to the other organizations in the level of intellectual impairment required to be present before a diagnosis of mental retardation can be assigned (i.e., IQ no higher than two standard deviations below the mean). For the other groups, however, that score has to be on the summary score attained on the intellectual functioning measure (e.g., equivalent to Wechsler FSIQ). SSA will also accept part scores from individually administered IQ tests, and specifically mentions Wechsler part scores as examples (e.g., VIQ, PIQ) in its regulations.',\n",
       " 'While SSA encourages the use of any standardized tests to determine intellectual and adaptive behavior functioning, it does not require these tests. It inadvertently gives preference to the Wechsler tests in its regulations by mentioning that the lowest of the overall summary score (FSIQ) and the two part scores (VIQ and PIQ) may be used in determining intellectual functioning. This not only cements a disparity among measures, without a solid empirical or policy basis, but also begs the question of whether one of these three scores provides the best relevant information. For instance, the FSIQ has higher reliability and validity coefficients than the two part scores. SSA needs to know if current practice and science support a policy of adjudicating on the basis of the lowest of multiple IQs; i.e., FSIQ, VIQ, or PIQ.',\n",
       " \"SSA further seeks to determine if its cutoff scores of 59 or less and 60 through 70 are also consistent with the current scientific literature on diagnosing mental retardation. The stringent upper limit fails to take into consideration the standard of error of measurement characteristic of all IQ tests. These basic assessment issues are further compounded when tests are administered to a culturally and linguistically diverse population. In some cases, instruments may not be available in a person's native language, or norming procedures may make the instrument inappropriate for use with some culturally and linguistically defined subpopulations.\",\n",
       " 'It is important to know whether the major instruments in the field, such as the Wechsler scales and Stanford-Binet Test of Intelligence, adequately assess intelligence in a given case. If they do not, clinically acceptable and programmatically workable alternative instruments should be explored. This may entail identifying other instruments (including nonverbal intelligence assessment instruments as well as instruments available in languages other than English) that have sufficient reliability and validity to adequately diagnose mental retardation. Of course, any additional instruments identified should have the potential for wide use in clinical practice settings.',\n",
       " 'A number of research areas have produced reliable findings that are relevant and ready for implementation in practice. Advances in the assessment of developmental functioning have expanded the examination of intelligence from a dependence on verbal and performance intelligence scores to a broader view that incorporates measures of process as well as product. Multiple components that comprise intellectual functioning can now be more easily separated, for example, attentional processes, computational processes, problem-solving skills, and performance processes.',\n",
       " \"In the area of developmental assessment, standardized preschool measures of competence (Bayley, 1993) are required to assess multiple domains of functioning. These include fine motor, gross motor, cognitive, communication, and social skills. Impairment judgments based only on verbal and performance IQs may not reflect current intelligence testing practices for preschool children. The committee was charged with determining if other instruments better assess young children's intellectual functioning.\",\n",
       " 'For individuals with an intelligence score greater than 59, SSA requires documentation of deficits in adaptive behavior and functioning in order for a classification of mental retardation to be made, as long as no other serious medical condition is present. This may include the results of standardized tests (e.g., Scales of Independent-Behavior-Revised, Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales) or descriptions from parents, teachers, or treating clinicians. The use of either descriptive evidence or standardized test results seems to reflect variations in practice throughout the field of mental retardation. AAMR and the American Psychiatric Association both allow for behavioral descriptors of adaptive behavior in order to diagnose mental retardation. Division 33 of the American Psychological Association and WHO, however, suggest that results from standardized psychological assessments should be used (Jacobson & Mulick, 1996).',\n",
       " 'SSA has asked the committee for advice on how best to assess adaptive behavior for eligibility determination and award of benefits. With its current practice, SSA may frequently receive different kinds of information from different sources. The lack of standardization in the assessment of adaptive behavior may lead to a number of difficulties. Currently, claims may be adjudicated on the basis of different kinds of information, and trained lay examiners have the responsibility of combining data from different sources to try and sift out any evidence of deficits in adaptive behavior functioning, working in concert with medical consultants. The result may be inconsistent decision making and a time-consuming determination process.',\n",
       " 'Other important issues are how well major current measures of communicative, social, personal, motor, and community living skills identify and quantify deficits in adaptive behavior, and how well they meet current standards of reliability and validity. The committee explored alternative approaches that are clinically acceptable and programmatically workable, as well as measures that are currently used but are not satisfactory.',\n",
       " 'Describing the nature of behavioral deficits becomes most needed—and most problematic—for individuals whose IQ is close to 70. Currently, SSA combines standardized IQ data with varying kinds of information on adaptive functioning. For adults, disability examiners consider adjustment in occupational and social settings; self-care is also a focus. For children, adjustment, including meeting developmental expectations, is a focus. There are, however, no guidelines about how to consistently combine these two kinds of information.',\n",
       " 'SSA is interested in the unique contribution each type of measure makes to the analysis of the adjustment of the individual to his or her world. A subset of this issue is the particular contribution of each to the evaluation and diagnosis of mental retardation in borderline situations, i.e., in cases in which the obtained IQ hovers near 70.',\n",
       " 'Current SSA practices allow a wide role for the qualitative evaluation of performance. Advances in the study of adaptive functioning have provided a more differentiated view of individual social and personal competence. Reviewing current thinking on the multiple dimensions of adaptive functioning could produce new models for such assessment or improve the utility of older assessments by identifying or updating appropriate cutoff scores for disability, or it may point to desirable and justified alterations of functional areas that are the focus of review in the eligibility determination process. The committee has reviewed the practice of allowing qualitative assessments of adaptive functioning, as well as instruments that provide standardized evaluations of adaptive functioning.',\n",
       " \"The issue of better differentiating mental retardation from other disorders that may have similar behavioral and cognitive manifestations—called differential diagnosis—is considered last. SSA has had particular difficulty distinguishing mental retardation from other disorders in children and adolescents. The Sullivan v. Zebley decision in 1990, in which the U.S. Supreme Court relaxed the criteria whereby children became eligible for SSI benefits; changes in determination criteria secondary to the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996; and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 have all resulted in criticisms of SSA's attempts to distinguish mental retardation from other cognitive disabilities.\",\n",
       " 'A number of conditions, such as autism, learning disabilities, borderline intellectual functioning, and some organic mental disorders, like traumatic brain injury, are associated with features that overlap with those seen in mental retardation. In addition, some genetic and behavioral disorders share features with mental retardation.',\n",

The committee summarizes here its finding with respect to additional research that might improve the assessment and diagnosis of mental retardation. It is important to know what research needs to be conducted so that individuals with mental retardation can be better identified and can therefore have access to more appropriate services from education, health, and social service agencies. This question is designed to address the long-term needs of SSA and disability benefit recipients.',\n",

       " \"Literature searches were conducted in peer-reviewed journals; technical manuals on intelligence and adaptive behavior measures were reviewed; papers were commissioned from experts on a number of topics central to the committee's work; and feedback was solicited from professional practice, advocacy, and other relevant groups. Members also reviewed technical and policy literature from SSA and other government agencies to get a better sense of the disability programs and benefits provided to individuals with mental retardation. To better understand the practical and policy implications of proposed recommendations on benefit receipt, the committee conducted statistical procedures called Monte Carlo simulations to examine the consequences of altering the criteria for scores on intelligence and adaptive behavior measures. In all of its review work, the committee focused in particular on the area of mild mental retardation, which is most problematic.\",\n",

The first, do current IQ tests adequately reflect widely accepted concepts of intelligence, is discussed in Chapter 3. The second asks how adaptive functioning is best defined and assessed; the committee's detailed response is in Chapter 4. SSA also asked about the relationship between measures of intelligence and adaptive behavior, which is covered in Chapter 5. Chapter 6, on differential diagnosis, explains how the conditions that share signs and symptoms with mental retardation are best distinguished from it.

       " \"Intellectual disability (ID), also known as general learning disability (in the United Kingdom[3]) and mental retardation,[4][5] is a generalized neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by significant impairment in intellectual and adaptive functioning that is first apparent during childhood. Children with intellectual disabilities typically have an intelligence quotient (IQ) below 70 and deficits in at least two adaptive behaviors that affect everyday, general living. According to the DSM-5, intellectual functions include reasoning, problem solving, planning, abstract thinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience.[6] Deficits in these functions must be confirmed by clinical evaluation and individualized standard IQ testing. On the other hand, adaptive behaviors include the social, developmental, and practical skills people learn to perform tasks in their everyday lives.[7] Deficits in adaptive functioning often compromises an individual's independence and ability to meet their social responsibility.[8]\\n\",\n",
       " 'Intellectual disability is subdivided into syndromic intellectual disability, in which intellectual deficits associated with other medical and behavioral signs and symptoms are present, and non-syndromic intellectual disability, in which intellectual deficits appear without other abnormalities.[9] Down syndrome and fragile X syndrome are examples of syndromic intellectual disabilities.\\n',\n",
       " 'Intellectual disability affects about 2 to 3% of the general population.[10] Seventy-five to ninety percent of the affected people have mild intellectual disability.[10] Non-syndromic, or idiopathic cases account for 30 to 50% of these cases.[10] About a quarter of cases are caused by a genetic disorder,[10] and about 5% of cases are inherited.[11] Cases of unknown cause affect about 95 million people as of 2013[update].[12]\\n',\n",
       " 'Intellectual disability (ID) becomes apparent during childhood and involves deficits in mental abilities, social skills, and core activities of daily living (ADLs) when compared to same-aged peers.[13] There often are no physical signs of mild forms of ID, although there may be characteristic physical traits when it is associated with a genetic disorder (e.g., Down syndrome).[14]\\n',\n",
       " 'The level of impairment ranges in severity for each person. Some of the early signs can include:[14]\\n',\n",
       " 'In early childhood, mild ID (IQ 50–69) may not be obvious or identified until children begin school.[10][16][additional citation(s) needed] Even when poor academic performance is recognized, it may take expert assessment to distinguish mild intellectual disability from specific learning disability or emotional/behavioral disorders. People with mild ID are capable of learning reading and mathematics skills to approximately the level of a typical child aged nine to twelve. They can learn self-care and practical skills, such as cooking or using the local mass transit system. As individuals with intellectual disabilities reach adulthood, many learn to live independently and maintain gainful employment.[10][17] About 85% of persons with ID are likely to have mild ID.\\n',\n",
       " 'Moderate ID (IQ 35–49) is nearly always apparent within the first years of life. Speech delays are particularly common signs of moderate ID. People with moderate intellectual disabilities need considerable support in school, at home, and in the community in order to fully participate. While their academic potential is limited, they can learn simple health and safety skills and to participate in simple activities. As adults, they may live with their parents, in a supportive group home, or even semi-independently with significant supportive services to help them, for example, manage their finances. As adults, they may work in a sheltered workshop.[10] About 10% of persons with ID are likely to have moderate ID.\\n',\n",
       " 'People with Severe ID (IQ 20–34), accounting for 3.5% of persons with ID, or Profound ID (IQ 19 or below), accounting for 1.5% of persons with ID, need more intensive support and supervision for their entire lives. They may learn some ADLs, but an intellectual disability is considered severe or profound when individuals are unable to independently care for themselves without ongoing significant assistance from a caregiver throughout adulthood.[10] Individuals with profound ID are completely dependent on others for all ADLs and to maintain their physical health and safety. They may be able to learn to participate in some of these activities to a limited degree.[14]\\n',\n",
       " \"Intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) share clinical characteristics which can result in confusion while diagnosing.[18] Overlapping these two disorders, while common, can be detrimental to a person's well-being. Those with ASD that hold symptoms of ID may be grouped into a co-diagnosis in which they are receiving treatment for a disorder they do not have. Likewise, those with ID that are mistaken to have ASD may be treated for symptoms of a disorder they do not have. Differentiating between these two disorders will allow clinicians to deliver or prescribe the appropriate treatments. Comorbidity between ID and ASD is very common; it was estimated that roughly 40% of those with ID also have ASD, and roughly 70% of those with ASD also have ID.[19] More recently, research has indicated a prevalence of roughly 30% for ID in individuals with ASD.[20][21][22][23] Both ASD and ID require shortfalls in communication and social awareness as defining criteria.[18]\\n\",\n",
       " 'In a study conducted in 2016 surveying 2816 cases, it was found that the top subsets that help differentiate between those with ID and ASD are, \"impaired non-verbal social behavior and lack of social reciprocity, [...] restricted interests, strict adherence to routines, stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms, and preoccupation with parts of objects\".[18] Those with ASD tend to show more deficits in non-verbal social behavior such as body language and understanding social cues. In a study done in 2008 of 336 individuals with varying levels of ID, it was found that those with ID display fewer instances of repetitive or ritualistic behaviors. It also recognized that those with ASD, when compared to those with ID, were more likely to isolate themselves and make less eye contact.[24] When it comes to classification ID and ASD have very different guidelines. ID has a standardized assessment called the Supports Intensity Scale (SIS); this measures severity on a system built around how much support an individual will need. While ASD also classifies severity by support needed, there is no standard assessment; clinicians are free to diagnose severity at their own judgment.[25]\\n',\n",
       " 'Among children, the cause of intellectual disability is unknown for one-third to one-half of cases.[10] About 5% of cases are inherited.[11] Genetic defects that cause intellectual disability, but are not inherited, can be caused by accidents or mutations in genetic development. Examples of such accidents are development of an extra chromosome 18 (trisomy 18) and Down syndrome, which is the most common genetic cause.[11] DiGeorge syndrome and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are the next most common causes.[10] Some other frequently observed causes include:\\n',\n",

Lewis Terman adapted Binet\\'s test and promoted it as a test measuring \"general intelligence\". Terman\\'s test was the first widely used mental test to report scores in \"intelligence quotient\" form (\"mental age\" divided by chronological age, multiplied by 100). Current tests are scored in \"deviation IQ\" form, with a performance level by a test-taker two standard deviations below the median score for the test-takers age group defined as IQ 70. Until the most recent revision of diagnostic standards, an IQ of 70 or below was a primary factor for intellectual disability diagnosis, and IQ scores were used to categorize degrees of intellectual disability.\\n',\n",
       " \"Since the current diagnosis of intellectual disability is not based on IQ scores alone, but must also take into consideration a person's adaptive functioning, the diagnosis is not made rigidly. It encompasses intellectual scores, adaptive functioning scores from an adaptive behavior rating scale based on descriptions of known abilities provided by someone familiar with the person, and also the observations of the assessment examiner, who is able to find out directly from the person what they can understand, communicate, and such like. IQ assessment must be based on a current test. This enables a diagnosis to avoid the pitfall of the Flynn effect, which is a consequence of changes in population IQ test performance changing IQ test norms over time.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Clinically, intellectual disability is a subtype of cognitive deficit or disabilities affecting intellectual abilities, which is a broader concept and includes intellectual deficits that are too mild to properly qualify as intellectual disability, or too specific (as in specific learning disability), or acquired later in life through acquired brain injuries or neurodegenerative diseases like dementia. Cognitive deficits may appear at any age. Developmental disability is any disability that is due to problems with growth and development. This term encompasses many congenital medical conditions that have no mental or intellectual components, although it, too, is sometimes used as a euphemism for intellectual disability.[39]\\n',\n",
       " \"Adaptive behavior, or adaptive functioning, refers to the skills needed to live independently (or at the minimally acceptable level for age). To assess adaptive behavior, professionals compare the functional abilities of a child to those of other children of similar age. To measure adaptive behavior, professionals use structured interviews, with which they systematically elicit information about persons' functioning in the community from people who know them well. There are many adaptive behavior scales, and accurate assessment of the quality of someone's adaptive behavior requires clinical judgment as well. Certain skills are important to adaptive behavior, such as:\\n\",\n",
       " \"Other specific skills can be critical to an individual's inclusion in the community and to develop appropriate social behaviors, as for example being aware of the different social expectations linked to the principal lifespan stages (i.e., childhood, adulthood, old age). The results of a Swiss study suggest that the performance of adults with ID in recognizing different lifespan stages is related to specific cognitive abilities and to the type of material used to test this performance.[40]\\n\",\n",
       " 'By most definitions, intellectual disability is more accurately considered a disability rather than a disease. Intellectual disability can be distinguished in many ways from mental illness, such as schizophrenia or depression. Currently, there is no \"cure\" for an established disability, though with appropriate support and teaching, most individuals can learn to do many things. Causes, such as congenital hypothyroidism, if detected early may be treated to prevent the development of an intellectual disability.[41]\\n',\n",
       " 'There are thousands of agencies around the world that provide assistance for people with developmental disabilities. They include state-run, for-profit, and non-profit, privately run agencies. Within one agency there could be departments that include fully staffed residential homes, day rehabilitation programs that approximate schools, workshops wherein people with disabilities can obtain jobs, programs that assist people with developmental disabilities in obtaining jobs in the community, programs that provide support for people with developmental disabilities who have their own apartments, programs that assist them with raising their children, and many more. There are also many agencies and programs for parents of children with developmental disabilities.\\n',\n",
       " 'Beyond that, there are specific programs that people with developmental disabilities can take part in wherein they learn basic life skills. These \"goals\" may take a much longer amount of time for them to accomplish, but the ultimate goal is independence. This may be anything from independence in tooth brushing to an independent residence. People with developmental disabilities learn throughout their lives and can obtain many new skills even late in life with the help of their families, caregivers, clinicians and the people who coordinate the efforts of all of these people.\\n',\n",
       " 'There are four broad areas of intervention that allow for active participation from caregivers, community members, clinicians, and of course, the individual(s) with an intellectual disability. These include psychosocial treatments, behavioral treatments, cognitive-behavioral treatments, and family-oriented strategies.[42] Psychosocial treatments are intended primarily for children before and during the preschool years as this is the optimum time for intervention.[43] This early intervention should include encouragement of exploration, mentoring in basic skills, celebration of developmental advances, guided rehearsal and extension of newly acquired skills, protection from harmful displays of disapproval, teasing, or punishment, and exposure to a rich and responsive language environment.[44] A great example of a successful intervention is the Carolina Abecedarian Project that was conducted with over 100 children from low socioeconomic status families beginning in infancy through pre-school years. Results indicated that by age 2, the children provided the intervention had higher test scores than control group children, and they remained approximately 5 points higher 10 years after the end of the program. By young adulthood, children from the intervention group had better educational attainment, employment opportunities, and fewer behavioral problems than their control-group counterparts.[45]\\n',\n",
       " 'Core components of behavioral treatments include language and social skills acquisition. Typically, one-to-one training is offered in which a therapist uses a shaping procedure in combination with positive reinforcements to help the child pronounce syllables until words are completed. Sometimes involving pictures and visual aids, therapists aim at improving speech capacity so that short sentences about important daily tasks (e.g. bathroom use, eating, etc.) can be effectively communicated by the child.[46][47] In a similar fashion, older children benefit from this type of training as they learn to sharpen their social skills such as sharing, taking turns, following instruction, and smiling.[48] At the same time, a movement known as social inclusion attempts to increase valuable interactions between children with an intellectual disability and their non-disabled peers.[49] Cognitive-behavioral treatments, a combination of the previous two treatment types, involves a strategical-metastrategical learning technique[clarification needed] that teaches children math, language, and other basic skills pertaining to memory and learning. The first goal of the training is to teach the child to be a strategical thinker through making cognitive connections and plans. Then, the therapist teaches the child to be metastrategical by teaching them to discriminate among different tasks and determine which plan or strategy suits each task.[50] Finally, family-oriented strategies delve into empowering the family with the skill set they need to support and encourage their child or children with an intellectual disability. In general, this includes teaching assertiveness skills or behavior management techniques as well as how to ask for help from neighbors, extended family, or day-care staff.[51] As the child ages, parents are then taught how to approach topics such as housing/residential care, employment, and relationships. The ultimate goal for every intervention or technique is to give the child autonomy and a sense of independence using the acquired skills they have. In a 2019 Cochrane review on beginning reading interventions for children and adolescents with intellectual disability, small to moderate improvements in phonological awareness, word reading, decoding, expressive and receptive language skills, and reading fluency were noted when these elements were part of the teaching intervention.[52]\\n',\n",
       " 'Although there is no specific medication for intellectual disability, many people with developmental disabilities have further medical complications and may be prescribed several medications. For example, autistic children with developmental delay may be prescribed antipsychotics or mood stabilizers to help with their behavior. Use of psychotropic medications such as benzodiazepines in people with intellectual disability requires monitoring and vigilance as side effects occur commonly and are often misdiagnosed as behavioral and psychiatric problems.[53]\\n',\n",
       " 'Intellectual disability affects about 2–3% of the general population. 75–90% of the affected people have mild intellectual disability. Non-syndromic or idiopathic ID accounts for 30–50% of cases. About a quarter of cases are caused by a genetic disorder.[10] Cases of unknown cause affect about 95 million people as of 2013[update].[12] It is more common in males and in low to middle income countries.[41]\\n',\n",
       " '\\nIntellectual disability has been documented under a variety of names throughout history. Throughout much of human history, society was unkind to those with any type of disability, and people with intellectual disability were commonly viewed as burdens on their families.\\n',\n",
       " 'Greek and Roman philosophers, who valued reasoning abilities, disparaged people with intellectual disability as barely human. The oldest physiological view of intellectual disability is in the writings of Hippocrates in the late fifth century BCE, who believed that it was caused by an imbalance in the four humors in the brain. In ancient Rome people with intellectual disabilities had limited rights and were generally looked down upon.[54] They were considered property and could be kept slaves by their father.[55] These people could also not marry, hold office, or raise children. Many of them were killed early in the childhood, and then dumped into the Tiber in order to avoid them burdening society.[56] However, they were exempt from their crimes under Roman law,[57][58] and they were also used to perform menial labor.[59][60]\\n',\n",
       " 'Caliph Al-Walid (r. 705–715) built one of the first care homes for individuals with intellectual disabilities and built the first hospital which accommodated intellectually disabled individuals as part of its services. In addition, Al-Walid assigned each intellectually disabled individual a caregiver.[61]\\n',\n",
       " 'Until the Enlightenment in Europe, care and asylum was provided by families and the church (in monasteries and other religious communities), focusing on the provision of basic physical needs such as food, shelter, and clothing. Negative stereotypes were prominent in social attitudes of the time.\\n',\n",
       " 'In the 13th century, England declared people with intellectual disabilities to be incapable of making decisions or managing their affairs.[59] Guardianships were created to take over their financial affairs.\\n',\n",
       " 'In the 17th century, Thomas Willis provided the first description of intellectual disability as a disease.[59] He believed that it was caused by structural problems in the brain. According to Willis, the anatomical problems could be either an inborn condition or acquired later in life.\\n',\n",
       " 'In the 18th and 19th centuries, housing and care moved away from families and towards an asylum model. People were placed by, or removed from, their families (usually in infancy) and housed in large professional institutions, many of which were self-sufficient through the labor of the residents. Some of these institutions provided a very basic level of education (such as differentiation between colors and basic word recognition and numeracy), but most continued to focus solely on the provision of basic needs of food, clothing, and shelter. Conditions in such institutions varied widely, but the support provided was generally non-individualized, with aberrant behavior and low levels of economic productivity regarded as a burden to society. Individuals of higher wealth were often able to afford higher degrees of care such as home care or private asylums.[62] Heavy tranquilization and assembly-line methods of support were the norm, and the medical model of disability prevailed. Services were provided based on the relative ease to the provider, not based on the needs of the individual. A survey taken in 1891 in Cape Town, South Africa shows the distribution between different facilities. Out of 2046 persons surveyed, 1,281 were in private dwellings, 120 in jails, and 645 in asylums, with men representing nearly two-thirds of the number surveyed. In situations of scarcity of accommodation, preference was given to white men and Black men (whose insanity threatened white society by disrupting employment relations and the taboo sexual contact with white women).[62]\\n',\n",
       " \"In the late 19th century, in response to Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, Francis Galton proposed selective breeding of humans to reduce intellectual disability.[59] Early in the 20th century, the eugenics movement became popular throughout the world. This led to forced sterilization and prohibition of marriage in most of the developed world and was later used by Adolf Hitler as a rationale for the mass murder of people with intellectual disability during the Holocaust. Eugenics was later abandoned as an violation of human rights, and the practice of forced sterilization and prohibition from marriage was discontinued by most of the developed world by the mid-20th century.\\n\",\n",

       " 'Ignoring the prevailing attitude, Civitans adopted service to people with developmental disabilities as a major organizational emphasis in 1952. Their earliest efforts included workshops for special education teachers and daycamps for children with disabilities, all at a time when such training and programs were almost nonexistent.[63] The segregation of people with developmental disabilities was not widely questioned by academics or policy-makers until the 1969 publication of Wolf Wolfensberger\\'s seminal work \"The Origin and Nature of Our Institutional Models\",[64] drawing on some of the ideas proposed by S. G. Howe 100 years earlier. This book posited that society characterizes people with disabilities as deviant, sub-human and burdens of charity, resulting in the adoption of that \"deviant\" role. Wolfensberger argued that this dehumanization, and the segregated institutions that result from it, ignored the potential productive contributions that all people can make to society. He pushed for a shift in policy and practice that recognized the human needs of those with intellectual disability and provided the same basic human rights as for the rest of the population.\\n',\n",
       " 'The publication of this book may be regarded as the first move towards the widespread adoption of the social model of disability in regard to these types of disabilities, and was the impetus for the development of government strategies for desegregation. Successful lawsuits against governments and increasing awareness of human rights and self-advocacy also contributed to this process, resulting in the passing in the U.S. of the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act in 1980.\\n',\n",
       " 'From the 1960s to the present, most states have moved towards the elimination of segregated institutions. Normalization and deinstitutionalization are dominant.[59] Along with the work of Wolfensberger and others including Gunnar and Rosemary Dybwad,[65] a number of scandalous revelations around the horrific conditions within state institutions created public outrage that led to change to a more community-based method of providing services.[66]\\n',\n",
       " 'By the mid-1970s, most governments had committed to de-institutionalization and had started preparing for the wholesale movement of people into the general community, in line with the principles of normalization. In most countries, this was essentially complete by the late 1990s, although the debate over whether or not to close institutions persists in some states, including Massachusetts.[67]\\n',\n",
       " 'In the past, lead poisoning and infectious diseases were significant causes of intellectual disability. Some causes of intellectual disability are decreasing, as medical advances, such as vaccination, increase. Other causes are increasing as a proportion of cases, perhaps due to rising maternal age, which is associated with several syndromic forms of intellectual disability.[citation needed]\\n',\n",
       " 'Along with the changes in terminology, and the downward drift in acceptability of the old terms, institutions of all kinds have had to repeatedly change their names. This affects the names of schools, hospitals, societies, government departments, and academic journals. For example, the Midlands Institute of Mental Sub-normality became the British Institute of Mental Handicap and is now the British Institute of Learning Disability. This phenomenon is shared with mental health and motor disabilities, and seen to a lesser degree in sensory disabilities.[citation needed]\\n',\n",
       " '\\nOver the past two decades, the term intellectual disability has become preferred by most advocates and researchers in most English-speaking countries.[5][14] In a 2012 survey of 101 Canadian healthcare professionals, 78% said they would use the term developmental delay with parents over intellectual disability (8%).[68] Expressions like developmentally disabled,[69] special, special needs, or challenged are sometimes used, but have been criticized for \"reinforc[ing] the idea that people cannot deal honestly with their disabilities\".[70][71]\\n',\n",
       " 'The term mental retardation, which stemmed from the understanding that such conditions arose as a result of delays or retardation of a child\\'s natural development,[72] was used in the American Psychiatric Association\\'s DSM-IV (1994) and in the World Health Organization\\'s ICD-10 (codes F70–F79). In the next revision, ICD-11, it was replaced by the term \"disorders of intellectual development\" (codes 6A00–6A04; 6A00.Z for the \"unspecified\" diagnosis code).[73][74] The term \"intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder)\" is used in the DSM-5 (2013).[14] The term \"mental retardation\" is still used in some professional settings such as governmental aid programs or health insurance paperwork, where \"mental retardation\" is specifically covered but \"intellectual disability\" is not.[75]\\n',\n",
       " 'Historical terms for intellectual disability eventually become perceived as an insult, in a process commonly known as the euphemism treadmill.[70][68] The terms mental retardation and mentally retarded became popular in the middle of the 20th century to replace the previous set of terms, which included \"imbecile\",[76][77] \"idiot\", \"feeble-minded\", and \"moron\",[78] among others, and are now considered offensive. By the end of the 20th century, retardation and retard become widely seen as disparaging, politically incorrect, and in need of replacement.[79]\\n',\n",
       " 'Usage has changed over the years and differed from country to country. For example, mental retardation in some contexts covers the whole field, but it previously applied to people with milder impairments. Feeble-minded used to mean mild impairments in the UK, and once applied in the US to the whole field. \"Borderline intellectual functioning\" is not currently defined, but the term may be used to apply to people with IQs in the 70s. People with IQs of 70 to 85 used to be eligible for special consideration in the US public education system on grounds of intellectual disability.[citation needed]\\n',\n",
       " 'The American Association on Mental Retardation changed its name to the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD) in 2007, and soon thereafter changed the names of its scholarly journals[80] to reflect the term \"intellectual disability\". In 2010, the AAIDD released its 11th edition of its terminology and classification manual, which also used the term intellectual disability.[81][82]\\n',\n",
       " 'In the UK, mental handicap had become the common medical term, replacing mental subnormality in Scotland and mental deficiency in England and Wales, until Stephen Dorrell, Secretary of State for Health for the United Kingdom from 1995 to 1997, changed the NHS\\'s designation to learning disability.[83] The new term is not yet widely understood, and is often taken to refer to problems affecting schoolwork (the American usage), which are known in the UK as \"learning difficulties\". British social workers may use \"learning difficulty\" to refer to both people with intellectual disability and those with conditions such as dyslexia.[84] In education, \"learning difficulties\" is applied to a wide range of conditions: \"specific learning difficulty\" may refer to dyslexia, dyscalculia or developmental coordination disorder, while \"moderate learning difficulties\", \"severe learning difficulties\" and \"profound learning difficulties\" refer to more significant impairments.[85][86] The term \"Profound and Multiple Learning Disability/ies\" (PMLD) is used: the NHS describes PMLD as \"when a person has a severe learning disability and other disabilities that significantly affect their ability to communicate and be independent\".[87][88]\\n',\n",
       " 'In England and Wales between 1983 and 2008, the Mental Health Act 1983 defined \"mental impairment\" and \"severe mental impairment\" as \"a state of arrested or incomplete development of mind which includes significant/severe impairment of intelligence and social functioning and is associated with abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct on the part of the person concerned.\"[89] As behavior was involved, these were not necessarily permanent conditions: they were defined for the purpose of authorizing detention in hospital or guardianship. The term mental impairment was removed from the Act in November 2008, but the grounds for detention remained. However, English statute law uses mental impairment elsewhere in a less well-defined manner—e.g. to allow exemption from taxes—implying that intellectual disability without any behavioral problems is what is meant.\\n',\n",
       " 'A 2008 BBC poll conducted in the United Kingdom came to the conclusion that \\'retard\\' was the most offensive disability-related word.[90] On the reverse side of that, when a contestant on Celebrity Big Brother live used the phrase \"walking like a retard\", despite complaints from the public and the charity Mencap, the communications regulator Ofcom did not uphold the complaint saying \"it was not used in an offensive context [...] and had been used light-heartedly\". It was, however, noted that two previous similar complaints from other shows were upheld.[91]\\n',\n",
       " 'In the past, Australia has used British and American terms interchangeably, including \"mental retardation\" and \"mental handicap\". Today, \"intellectual disability\" is the preferred and more commonly used descriptor.[92]\\n',\n",
       " 'People with intellectual disabilities are often not seen as full citizens of society. Person-centered planning and approaches are seen as methods of addressing the continued labeling and exclusion of socially devalued people, such as people with disabilities, encouraging a focus on the person as someone with capacities and gifts as well as support needs. The self-advocacy movement promotes the right of self-determination and self-direction by people with intellectual disabilities, which means allowing them to make decisions about their own lives.\\n',\n",
       " 'Until the middle of the 20th century, people with intellectual disabilities were routinely excluded from public education, or educated away from other typically developing children. Compared to peers who were segregated in special schools, students who are mainstreamed or included in regular classrooms report similar levels of stigma and social self-conception, but more ambitious plans for employment.[93] As adults, they may live independently, with family members, or in different types of institutions organized to support people with disabilities. About 8% currently live in an institution or a group home.[94]\\n',\n",
       " 'In the United States, the average lifetime cost of a person with an intellectual disability amounts to $223,000 per person, in 2003 US dollars, for direct costs such as medical and educational expenses.[94] The indirect costs were estimated at $771,000, due to shorter lifespans and lower than average economic productivity.[94] The total direct and indirect costs, which amount to a little more than a million dollars, are slightly more than the economic costs associated with cerebral palsy, and double that associated with serious vision or hearing impairments.[94] Of the costs, about 14% is due to increased medical expenses (not including what is normally incurred by the typical person), and 10% is due to direct non-medical expenses, such as the excess cost of special education compared to standard schooling.[94] The largest amount, 76%, is indirect costs accounting for reduced productivity and shortened lifespans.[94] Some expenses, such as ongoing costs to family caregivers or the extra costs associated with living in a group home, were excluded from this calculation.[94]\\n',\n",
       " 'The law treats person with intellectual disabilities differently than those without intellectual disabilities. Their human rights and freedoms, including the right to vote, the right to conduct business, enter into a contract, enter into marriage, right to education, are often limited. The courts have upheld some of these limitations and found discrimination in others. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which sets minimum standards for the rights of persons with disabilities, has been ratified by more than 180 countries. In several U.S. states, and several European Union states, persons with intellectual disabilities are disenfranchised.[95][96] The European Court of Human Rights ruled in Alajos Kiss v. Hungary (2010) that Hungary cannot restrict voting rights only on the basis of guardianship due to a psychosocial disability.[97]\\n',\n",
       " 'People with intellectual disabilities are usually at a higher risk of living with complex health conditions such as epilepsy and neurological disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and behavioral and psychiatric problems compared to people without disabilities.[98] Adults also have a higher prevalence of poor social determinants of health, behavioral risk factors, depression, diabetes, and poor or fair health status than adults without intellectual disability.\\n',\n",
       " 'In the United Kingdom people with intellectual disability live on average 16 years less than the general population. Some of the barriers that exist for people with ID accessing quality healthcare include: communication challenges, service eligibility, lack of training for healthcare providers, diagnostic overshadowing, and absence of targeted health promotion services.[99][100] Key recommendations from the CDC for improving the health status for people with intellectual disabilities include: improve access to health care, improve data collection, strengthen the workforce, include people with ID in public health programs, and prepare for emergencies with people with disabilities in mind.[101]\\n']"
